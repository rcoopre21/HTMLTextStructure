<h2>My Idea</h2>
<p> I want to make a website about my art/future goals in art. <br>
It will display things such as what supplies I enjoy using, <br>
how and what I draw, artists that inspire me, <br>
my experiences as an artist, and my history with drawing. </p> 

</article>

<section id="section2">
 I'd want to have a page specfically for my insperation. <br>
  It will talk about some of my favorite artists and comic books, <br>
  graphic novels, games, and shows that inspire me. 
 <br>
  </section>
<section id="section3">
 I also want to have a page for what art supplies I use. <br>
 It will desplay things such as what's best when you're on a <br>
 budget or can spend as much as you want and my personal favorite items.
